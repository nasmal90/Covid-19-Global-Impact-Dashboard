\
## Introduction\
The **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard** visualizes key metrics related to the global COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to provide insights into total cases, deaths, infection rates, and trends across continents and countries using Tableau.\
\
## Objective\
The primary objectives of this project are to:\
- Visualize and track the global COVID-19 spread.\
- Perform time-series analysis to forecast future infection trends.\
- Display key metrics like total cases, deaths, and infection percentages across continents and countries.\
\
## Tools Used\
- **Tableau**: For dashboard and visualization creation.\
- **Python (Pandas)**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.\
- **Excel**: To organize and structure data used in Tableau.\
\
## Dataset\
The datasets used in this project are:\
- `CovidDeaths.xlsx`: Contains global COVID-19 death data by country.\
- `CovidVaccinations.xlsx`: Contains COVID-19 vaccination data by country.\
\
## Key Visualizations\
\
1. **Global Numbers**: Displays total COVID-19 cases, deaths, and the death percentage.\

\
2. **Total Deaths per Continent**: A bar chart showing total death counts by continent.\

\
3. **Percent Population Infected per Country**: A heatmap showing infection percentages by country.\

\
4. **Time-Series Analysis**: A line chart showing the percentage of the population infected over time across several countries, including forecasting.\

\
## Instructions to Run\
\
1. Open `Covid Dashboard.twbx` in Tableau to explore the visualizations.\
2. Alternatively, view the data visualizations from the `visualizations/` folder for a quick overview.\
\
## Results & Insights\
- **Europe and North America** reported the highest COVID-19 death counts.\
- The **United States** and **United Kingdom** showed rapid infection growth over the time period studied, with the U.S. forecasted to continue growing at the highest rate.\
- A heatmap analysis revealed that countries like the **U.S.**, **Brazil**, and **India** experienced some of the highest infection rates.\
