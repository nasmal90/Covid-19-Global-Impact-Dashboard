# 🌍 **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard**

## 📊 **Introduction**
The **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard** provides a comprehensive and interactive analysis of the global pandemic using **Tableau**. This project offers key insights into the total cases, deaths, infection rates, and pandemic trends across various continents and countries. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for tracking and understanding the worldwide impact of COVID-19.

## 🎯 **Objective**
The main objectives of this project are to:
- 🗺️ **Track and visualize** the global spread of COVID-19 across different regions.
- 📈 **Perform time-series analysis** to forecast infection trends.
- 🔍 **Highlight key metrics** like total cases, deaths, and infection percentages by continent and country.

## 🔧 **Tools & Technologies**
- **Tableau**: For building interactive dashboards and creating data visualizations.
- **Python (Pandas)**: For data preprocessing, transformation, and cleaning before feeding into Tableau.
- **Excel**: Used for organizing and structuring datasets that were later used for visualization.

## 📂 **Datasets**
The project makes use of two primary datasets:
- **CovidDeaths.xlsx**: Contains global COVID-19 death statistics, broken down by country and continent.
- **CovidVaccinations.xlsx**: Contains vaccination data from various countries, providing context to the spread and containment of the virus.

## 📊 **Key Visualizations**
