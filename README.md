# **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard**

## **Introduction**  
The **COVID-19 Global Impact Dashboard** presents a comprehensive visual analysis of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. This project leverages Tableau to provide key insights into total cases, deaths, infection rates, and trends across various continents and countries.

## **Objective**  
This project aims to:  
- **Track and visualize** the spread of COVID-19 across the globe.  
- **Perform time-series analysis** to forecast infection trends.  
- **Highlight key metrics** like total cases, deaths, and infection percentages by continent and country.  

## **Tools & Technologies**  
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizations.  
- **Python (Pandas)**: Used for data preprocessing and cleaning.  
- **Excel**: Organized datasets that fed into Tableau for visualization.  

## **Datasets**  
- **CovidDeaths.xlsx**: A dataset containing global COVID-19 death statistics, broken down by country.  
- **CovidVaccinations.xlsx**: A dataset with vaccination data from various countries.

## **Key Visualizations**
